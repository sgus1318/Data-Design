    "#### Bag of Words\n",
    "* A way to convert unstructured text data into structured text data as a common vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A bit about what Bag of Words is:\n",
    "* Vectorization is the general process of turning a collection of text documents into numerical feature vectors\n",
    "* Each document is a literal bag of words. It doesn't care about the sequence of words or sentence structures or anything like that.\n",
    "* Looks at word occurrences and completely ignores relative position information, grammar, punctuation\n",
    "* Usually you convert everything to lowercase, remove punctuation, remove markup, stop-words, etc.\n",
    "* Corpus = collection of text documents\n",
    "* Each word is treated as a feature\n",
    "* 3 step process:\n",
    "    * Tokenization: split document up\n",
    "    * Vocabulary building: all the words in the corpus. Non-repetitive.\n",
    "    * Encoding: transform a sequence of documents into a document-term matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the given BoW Vocabulary, create a feature vector (vectorized representation) of the following text documents:\n",
    "* John likes to watch movies. Mary likes movies too.\n",
    "* John also likes to watch football games.\n",
